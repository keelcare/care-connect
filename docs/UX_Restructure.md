# CareConnect UX Restructure Guide
### Post-Landing Page Flow & Information Architecture

This document outlines recommended UX changes to improve trust, emotional safety, and decision-making for CareConnect users after the landing page.

The goal is to shift from a **marketplace-first experience** to a **care-first, guided experience**.

---

## 1. UX Principle (Why This Change Matters)

Caregiving is a **high-stakes, emotional decision**.

Users are not primarily looking to browse options.
They are looking for:
- Reassurance
- Guidance
- Confidence in their choice

**Design implication:**  
Do not lead with lists. Lead with understanding.

---

## 2. Key UX Decision

### Is “Browse” Important?
- ✅ Yes, but **not as the primary entry point**
- ❌ No, it should not be the default post-landing page

**Browse implies shopping behavior**, which increases anxiety in caregiving contexts.

## 3. Recommended Post-Landing Page Flow

### Current Flow (Marketplace-Oriented)


---

## 4. New Primary Page: “Find Care” (Guided Flow)

### Purpose
- Reduce overwhelm
- Help users articulate needs
- Build trust before showing options

### Page Characteristics
- Conversational tone
- One decision per step
- No long forms
- No large lists

### Example Steps
1. Who do you need care for?
   - Child
   - Senior
   - Pet
   - Special Needs

2. What kind of help do you need?
   - Full-day
   - Part-time
   - Occasional

3. When do you need care?
   - Date / Ongoing

4. Where is care needed?
   - Location

> This page should feel like a conversation, not a filter form.

## 5. “Recommended Caregivers” Page (After Find Care)

### Purpose
- Reduce choice overload
- Increase confidence
- Show that CareConnect helps choose wisely

### Design Rules
- Show **5–8 caregivers max**
- Clearly explain *why* each caregiver is recommended
- Use reassuring microcopy

### Example Recommendation Labels
- “Trusted by families near you”
- “Great with first-time parents”
- “Highly rated for patience and reliability”

---

## 6. Caregiver Profile Page (Decision Page)

### Emotional Goal
Make users feel like they are **meeting a person**, not evaluating a listing.

### Content Priority Order
1. Caregiver photo (human first)
2. Short personal introduction
3. Experience & specialties
4. Reviews (emotion-first, not just stars)
5. Pricing and availability

### CTA Guidance
Avoid aggressive CTAs like:
- “Book Now”

Prefer:
- “View Availability”
- “Talk to Caregiver”
- “Ask a Question”

---

## 7. Role of “Browse” Going Forward

### Where Browse Lives
- Secondary navigation
- Inside “Find Care” as an optional path
- Accessible but not dominant

### How Browse Should Be Framed
Rename or subtitle Browse as:
- “Browse all caregivers”
- “Explore caregivers on your own”

This signals autonomy without pressure.

---

## 8. Navigation Restructure (Top-Level)

### Recommended Primary Navigation
1. Find Care
2. How We Help You Choose
3. Caregivers Near You
4. Browse (secondary)

### Sidebar / Dashboard Priority
1. Find Care
2. Recommended for You
3. Messages
4. Browse
5. Saved Caregivers
6. Bookings
7. Settings

---

## 9. UX Rules to Follow Across Pages

- Fewer choices = more trust
- Emotional reassurance before action
- Data supports trust, not replaces it
- Slowing users down is sometimes good UX

---


---

## 11. Summary

- Browse is a **tool**, not a starting point
- Guided flows reduce anxiety
- CareConnect should feel like a **trusted advisor**, not a listing platform
- Trust-first UX leads to better decisions and long-term retention
