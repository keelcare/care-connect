## Average Rating Integration

The average rating for users (especially nannies) is **automatically calculated** and included in User API responses. You do **not** need to calculate it manually from the reviews list.

### Get User with Average Rating

**GET** `/users/:id`

Returns user details with `averageRating` and `totalReviews` fields (for nannies).

**Response** (200 OK):

```json
{
  "id": "user-uuid",
  "email": "nanny@example.com",
  "role": "nanny",
  "profiles": {
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "profile_image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
  },
  "nanny_details": {
    "hourly_rate": 25,
    "experience_years": 5,
    "skills": ["CPR", "First Aid"]
  },
  "averageRating": 4.7,
  "totalReviews": 12
}
```

### Get All Nannies with Ratings

**GET** `/users/nannies`

Returns all nannies with their average ratings.

**Response**: Array of user objects (same structure as above)

**Notes**:

- `averageRating` is rounded to 1 decimal place
- `averageRating` is `null` if the user has no reviews
- `totalReviews` is always a number (0 if no reviews)

## TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
export interface Review {
  id: string;
  booking_id: string;
  reviewer_id: string;
  reviewee_id: string;
  rating: number; // Integer 1-5
  comment: string | null;
  created_at: string; // ISO Date String

  // The person who WROTE the review
  users_reviews_reviewer_idTousers?: {
    id: string;
    role: 'nanny' | 'parent' | 'admin';
    profiles: {
      first_name: string;
      last_name: string;
      profile_image_url: string | null;
    } | null;
  };

    profiles: {
      first_name: string;
      last_name: string;

}

export interface UpdateReviewDto {
  rating?: number; // 1-5
  comment?: string; // Max 1000 chars
}

## Frontend Integration Examples

### Example 1: Display Reviews on Nanny Profile

```typescript
// Fetch nanny profile with average rating
const nanny = await fetch(`/users/${nannyId}`).then((r) => r.json());

// Display: "⭐ 4.7 (12 reviews)"
console.log(`⭐ ${nanny.averageRating} (${nanny.totalReviews} reviews)`);

// Fetch individual reviews
const reviews = await fetch(`/reviews/nanny/${nannyId}`).then((r) => r.json());

reviews.forEach((review) => {
  const reviewerName =
    review.users_reviews_reviewer_idTousers?.profiles?.first_name;
  console.log(`${reviewerName} rated ${review.rating}/5: ${review.comment}`);
});
```

### Example 2: Leave a Review After Booking

```typescript
// Check if user can review
const eligibility = await fetch(`/reviews/booking/${bookingId}/can-review`, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
}).then((r) => r.json());

if (eligibility.canReview) {
  // Show review form
  const reviewData = {
    bookingId: bookingId,
    rating: 5,
    comment: 'Great experience!',
  };

  await fetch('/reviews', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(reviewData),
  });
} else {
  // Show reason why they can't review
  console.log(eligibility.reason);
}
```

### Example 3: Edit a Review

```typescript
const updateData = {
  rating: 4,
  comment: 'Updated my review',
};

await fetch(`/reviews/${reviewId}`, {
  method: 'PATCH',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(updateData),
});
```

## Important Notes

1. **Property Names**: The Prisma relation properties have verbose names (e.g., `users_reviews_reviewer_idTousers`). These are auto-generated and must be used as-is in your frontend.

2. **Single Rating System**: The current implementation uses a single 1-5 star rating. Granular ratings (punctuality, professionalism, etc.) are not currently implemented.

3. **Booking Status**: Reviews can only be created for bookings with status `COMPLETED`.

4. **One Review Per User Per Booking**: Each user (parent or nanny) can only leave one review per booking, but a booking can have up to 2 reviews total (one from each party).

5. **Public vs Protected**: Read operations are generally public (anyone can view reviews), but write operations require authentication.

6. **Average Rating Calculation**: The backend automatically calculates and includes `averageRating` in User responses. You don't need to manually calculate it from the reviews array.
